# Customizable TicTacToe

## Play a customizable game of TicTacToe in command line Python.

This project allows the user to customize the size of the playing board and the amount of Xs or Os needed in a row, column or diagonal to win.

## Demo images for some sample games

## Notes
- Although only 1 game can be played at once, the user can initialize multiple games and play them in succession

## WIP
- GUI to replace command-line gameplay
- Score-keeping
